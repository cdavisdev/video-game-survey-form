# video-game-survey-form
A video game related survey form. The form is coded using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. This form shows validation on all input fields required to be entered (apart from last one, which is optional).

# How to use / General Information

To use the form, simply fill in the various radio buttons, checkbox buttons, dropdown menus and comment boxes. The application will style either 'red' to indicate that this field is either not filled in or correct, or 'green' to indicate that this field has been entered and is correct/passed validation.

Once the form has been completed, the web application will display a message to indicate to the user that the form has now been completed, and after few seconds, will refresh the page.

This application is an update/remake of a version that I had made from 2019 and improved the JavaScript and UI. This web application makes use of Regex, ternary operator, reusable functions, error messages/styling display on HTML and setTimeout() on submit.

This survey form is for demonstration purposes only.

Originally developed in 2019.
New version developed in 2020.
